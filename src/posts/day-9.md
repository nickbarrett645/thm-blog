I kept my streak alive by answering a single question in the NMap room. My parents came to visit today for the weekend so I probably wont be able to do much with it until Sunday. I'll probably try to do a couple rooms then to make up for it. The NMap room should be pretty easy since I've used the tool before. I'm a little rusty but all I need is a refresher.
