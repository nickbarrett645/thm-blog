I'm working on the NMap room. It looks long but this one seems like its more interactive than some of the rooms so far. It'll be nice to scan some targets finally.

The NMap switches section was easy, its all in the man page.

This room actually went pretty quick. The readings were short and there were not a ton of questions to answer.

There was not as much scanning as I thought there might be but it was still interesing.
