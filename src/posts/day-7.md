Starting the **Complete Beginner** learning path today. I expect it to be mostly easy, much like the Presecurity path, but there should be some interesting stuff in some of the rooms.

The first room should have been one first room done when you start using THM, that was too easy and pointless after having done a bunch of rooms.

The second room just as easy, but makes sense where it is in the beginner path. On to the next!

Introductory Research the second section 4th question didnt even make sense I had to really dig for that one, and then it ended up being an answer that something I didn't expect.

The vulnerability search was very straight forward I just used the online version of [ExploitDB](https://www.exploit-db.com/) and for the man pages section I didn't even have to look them up, I could just guess what the flag was suppose to be.

With that I finished the Complete Beginner Introduction module and since I already have Linux fundamentals completed I can jump to Netowrk Explotation Basics. Ill probably just complete the first room and then call it a day.

Task 2 through 4 of Introductory Networking were pretty easy since all that stuff was convered by What is Networking in the Presecurity path/ Maybe Some of that stuff can be consolidated? Never the less I breezed through those.

Ping section was easy except I didn't see the anwser to the switch that allows you to restrict requests to IPV4 I just guessed.

Traceroute also easy again I could just guess the flags.

The whois section was also easy but I did have to run the command twice for microsoft.com because it did not return all the info the first time.

Dig was also easy, there weren't any issues there. I would reccomend running a dig command against a domain though to see the result come back.

So after seven days I've completed 20 rooms and one full learning path. Im definitely feeling good about the process so far. I don't want to over do it but I defintiely want to get to 365 days of hacking and 365 days of blogs.

I'm still trying to figure out a more ogranized structure for these blogs so they could potentially be a little more useful. I want to do one thing each day to improve the site. I tihnk next two items on the list will be a CICD process, which is already sort of in place with Netlify.

Happy hacking and see you tomorrow!
