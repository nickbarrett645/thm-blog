What is this? This is just something I want to do for fun. I want to spend more time doing a hobby that is productive and interesting. Working in tech you learn by doing so this is me killing two birds with one stone. Actually when all things are said and done it will probably be multiple birds as I plan on tackling web development, CICD, and of course cyber security.
