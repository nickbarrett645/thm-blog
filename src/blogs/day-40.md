## Process Reflection
After doing a THM exercise and a blog everyday for over a month I did some reflecting on how the process was going so far. My iniital thought when I started this project was if I kept writing everyday it would get better from the repitition. That may be true to a certain extent, but at this point I still didn't have a good structure for blogs, I didn't think what was getting produced was all that useful, I hadn't made any improvements to the site, and I hadn't been able to touch other areas like adding to the CI/CD process. All the effort was going into doing the exercises and trying to get some notes of what I did in a blog. I wasn't spending any time working on any of the items I just mentioned and if you aren't working on the right things you are wasting your time.

I want this process to be about incremental improvements. The writing should improve, the website's style and functionality should improve, the publishing process should improve. Moving forward instead of publishing a blog everyday I'm going to focus on publishing fewer higher quality blogs, and more improvements to the site. This site should be a way to improve my skills and act as a sort of resume. I want this site to look good and I want to be proud of it. 

Improving this website starts today. The new plan is to establish a structure for the blogs. Once I esablish a strucutre I will post my next blog.
