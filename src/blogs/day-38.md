Today I'm starting the [Metasploit: Exploitation](https://tryhackme.com/room/metasploitexploitation) module. Unfortuntely, I lost my streak yesterday so I'm starting over. I'm going for the 365 day streak so I need to be better about making time for doing this each morning. This weekend has been busy so I'm doing one question right now to start the streak again, but I also have made some changes to the blog itself, and I will continue to make improvements each day. I still want to add some CI/CD updates and restyle the blog
