Starting on Windows Fundamentals 1, not really familiar with using windows so this should be helpful
Downloaded Remote Desktop from the App Store, but using the in browser vm for now
Finished windows fundamentals 1 pretty easy, the only question that required some digging was TODO
Working on Two  going well so far Im trying to map windows concepts to unix concepts but Im sure it wonâ€™t always be a one to one
Definitely seems like windows is design to use the GUI more than command prompt, all these tools can be launched from the system configuration or the start menu
Window command prompt commands: hostname, whom, ifconfig, cls, netstat, net
/? Appended for help
Except for net where you need to do net help
Last few exercises were kind of boring, but I guess its just the fundamentals.
But I completed the Pre-Security learning path and overall I thought it was well done. It would definitely be useful to someone who has not experience and was digging into computers, networks, and security for the first time.
Tomorrow I will start on the complete beginner learning path
