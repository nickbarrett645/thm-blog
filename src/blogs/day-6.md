I'm starting on [Windows Fundamentals 1](https://tryhackme.com/room/windowsfundamentals1xbx), and I'm not familiar with using Windows so this should be helpful.

I downloaded Remote Desktop from the App Store, but I will be using the in browser VM for now.
I finished Windows Fundamentals 1 and I thought the room was easy.
I'm working on [Windows Fundamental 2](https://tryhackme.com/room/windowsfundamentals2x0x) and it's going well so far. I'm trying to map Windows concepts to Unix concepts but I'm sure it wonâ€™t always be a one to one.
It seems like Windows is design to use the GUI more than command prompt. The system configuration or start menu can launch all these tools.

Here are some of the Windows command prompt commands I learned: `hostname`, `whoami`, `ifconfig`, `cls`, `netstat`, `net`.

## Note
You can append `/?`, for help on some commands, like man pages.
Except for net where you need to do net help
Last exercises were kind of boring, but I guess its just the fundamentals.
I completed the [Pre Security](https://tryhackme.com/hacktivities) learning path and I thought the was well done. It would be useful to someone who has no experience and was digging into computers, networks, and security for the first time.
Tomorrow I will start on the complete beginner learning path.
