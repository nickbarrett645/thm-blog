I fully finished [How Websites Work](https://tryhackme.com/room/howwebsiteswork) and [Putting it all Together](https://tryhackme.com/room/puttingitalltogether).
I finished tasks 1 through 6 on [Linux Fundamentals 1](https://tryhackme.com/room/linuxfundamentalspart1).

## Note
I learned you could do `grep “string” file` instead of doing `cat file | grep "string"`, which I generally do. I also did `ls folder-*` to find file in a single command.
