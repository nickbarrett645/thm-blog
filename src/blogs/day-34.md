Today I'm starting the [Active Directory](https://tryhackme.com/room/activedirectorybasics) module. It's late so I'm answering one question to keep my streak alive and I'll try to finish the module tomorrow.

## Introduction
[Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/get-started/virtual-dc/active-directory-domain-services-overview) is a directory service developed by Microsoft for Windows domain networks. The components that compose Active Directory are:
- Domain Controllers
- Forests, Trees, Domains
- Users + Groups 
- Trusts
- Policies 
- Domain Services

Large companies use Active Directory because they can oversee their user's computers through a single domain controller. This allows any user in the company to use any machine that the company owns without having to set up more than one user on that machine.
